    "intro": "After working my way through The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp, I wanted to test my skills by building some sites of my own. The first site is a store of simple vegetarian recipes, the second is meant to be used as a starter for physics A-level students. Both sites were designed to be viewed on mobile but do have simple styling for when viewed on desktop.",

      "How to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM",

      "How to create a hamburger menu with an event listener",
      "How to use media queries to make the webpage responsive"
    ],
    "technologies": [
      "Fetch & Async/await - I needed to retrieve external data and async/await is my preferred method of handling a promise",
      "JavaScript - I wanted to dynamically display content depending on what the user has requested",
      "SASS - I used this for the vendor prefixes and styling. I find the nested hierarchy is much clearer than vanilla CSS"

      "Use a bundler, such as webpack, to separate the JavaScript into different files for a clearer codebase"
