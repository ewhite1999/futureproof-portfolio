    "intro": "After working my way through The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp, I wanted to test my skills by building some sites of my own. The first site is a store of simple vegetarian recipes, the second is meant to be used as a starter for physics A-level students. Both sites were designed to be viewed on mobile but do have simple styling for when viewed on desktop.",

    "title": "Confessions Page",
    "intro": "As a team of four, our goal was to create a site where users could view and anonymously post short confessions as well as comment on other peopleâ€™s. As with all projects, we had five days to create the site with a feature freeze coming at the end of the third day.",
    "role": [
      "My main role on this project was the front-end. I was responsible for using an API built by a teammate to fetch the required data, display the data onto confession cards, generate a form for the user to submit a new confession, use a different route on the API to store the new confession server-side, and styling the page.",
      "In addition to the front-end, one of my teammates and I were responsible for deploying the server-side on Heroku which gave me my first taste of environment variables."
